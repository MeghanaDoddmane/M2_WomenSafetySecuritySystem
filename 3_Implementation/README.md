This project mainly consists of temperature sensor, buzzer, pushbutton and these are connected to the digital I/O pins and the LCD display. Also it has Wi-Fi module and GPS module connected 
to digital I/O pins of the Arduino UNO board. To implement all these in a system we have to write a code in the software tool called Arduino IDE where we write the program to work the 
device. And the output like longitude and latitude of the location and temperature of the person will be displayed on the serial monitor. Later the output will be stored in the cloud i.e. ThingSpeak where the information 
received by the system will be uploaded and stored safely. By creating our own channel with the different fields we can upload the data. Also we can able to see whenever it is necessary
