Women face challenges in the workplace and safety become a major issue in most of the countries. Increase of issues like sexual harassment is one of the common offense happening frequently and the thought haunting in women mind is how to move freely in streets during the odd hours. In such critical situations to help women, we proposed an idea of using Internet of things (IoT) for Women Safety with alarm. IoT interconnects billions of devices and exchange useful information which plays a vital role in women safety. This paper summarizes the various safety measures available for women and this task goes under the piece of keen security. New perspective of women security caution framework with Arduino is proposed which has the capacity of sending SMS alert to the relatives of the victim so that women can go out and do things without hesitation. Our framework additionally has one Arduino robber alert in the framework which detects and warns the authorized person on any unauthorized intrusion. Thus the proposed system is reliable, low cost and user friendly helps women to overcome their fear in critical situation.
